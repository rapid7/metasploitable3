# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)
#
# Required modules: mod_dav, mod_dav_fs, mod_setenvif, mod_alias
#                   mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_file
#

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.


DavLockDB "c:/wamp/DavLock"

Alias /uploads "C:/wamp/www/uploads"

<Directory "C:/wamp/www/uploads">
	AllowOverride All
    Dav On

	<Limit GET HEAD POST DELETE OPTIONS PUT>
	    Order Allow,Deny
		Allow from all
	</Limit>

    #AuthType Digest
    # AuthName DAV-upload

    # You can use the htdigest program to create the password database:
    #   htdigest -c "c:/Apache2/user.passwd" DAV-upload admin
    # AuthUserFile "c:/Apache2/user.passwd"
    # AuthDigestProvider file

    # Allow universal read-access, but writes are restricted
    # to the admin user.
    #<LimitExcept GET OPTIONS>
    #    require user admin
    #</LimitExcept>
</Directory>

#
# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a 
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle 
# redirects for folders with DAV methods.
